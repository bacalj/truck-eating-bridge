      <p>The problem with these bridges is that they're too short. The obvious reasons, raising the bridge or moving the road down, still don't work because of the railroad on the red bridge, and the sewer below the road.

      <h2>what is the T.E.B.(truck eating bridge)?</h2>
      <p>The Truck-Eating Bridge(s) are these bridges that can't be moved up or down. They surround Northampton MA, and provide a dillema for any trailers coming in.
        What usually happens is that the trucks come into Northampton to go to Industrial Drive to get to the Coke factory. Theyâ€™re usually not from the area around or in Northampton, so when the GPS tells them to go through Main Street and though the bridge, they don't know that they're going to crash. So they crash.
